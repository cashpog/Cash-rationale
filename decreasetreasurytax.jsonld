    "comment": "I agree with this in general. I cannot however vote yes here, because it's the first year of the budget. This is an insult to the entire process, and implying bloat to a large extent. \n\nThe budget is not perfect, but we will learn a lot about future budgets from the first one. I would be much more open to a proposal of this nature after seeing how the first 6-7 months play out. I think there will be some bloat, especially with the .50c ADA price peg, but part of this process should be learning, adjusting, adapting, and progress. \n\nI agree in principle with a lot of the context of this Governance Action but unfortunately I cannot vote Yes until I see how the first iteration of the budget works or doesn't.
